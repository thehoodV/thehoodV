## TheHoodV

Offensive Security Researcher focused on Recon Automation, Attack Surface Mapping and Web Application Analysis.

I build tools and methodologies to scale reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery in large web applications.

## Focus Areas

- Reconnaissance automation with Playwright and Node.js
- JavaScript analysis for hidden endpoints
- Attack surface expansion
- Parameter and endpoint discovery
- Custom tooling for bug bounty workflows

## Methodology

My research focuses on building repeatable processes to map, analyze and expand web application attack surfaces efficiently.

All repositories here document tools, methodologies and case studies used during security research.
